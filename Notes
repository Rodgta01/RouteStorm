#Notes
1. Road ETA vs air-line distance - if you can run osrm locally or use something like OpenRouteService, swap the based matrix for road ETA - and you'll get better realism
2. Your weather source can be whatever you want as long as it's open source; Open-Meteo, Meteostat, NOAA/NWS - dealer's choice 
3. Use max(origin, destination) factors for simplicity. 
    a. For better, use any and all arrival timestamps per leg with propagated ETAs along the route and query weather per edge time
    b. Add sample for mid-segment weather 
4. You will need to set penalty values - I would start conservatively (10%-30% slow-downs) and calibrate with your telematics or GPS system
    a. Observed run times in rain/snow/wind
